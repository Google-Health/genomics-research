# Black Box Variational Inference for PRS (bbviPRS)

bbviPRS is a variational inference based technique for creating a polygenic risk
score (PRS) using GWAS summary statistics. Check out the [blog post](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2023-03-16-black-box-variational-inference-for-prs/) that describes this method.
